\begin{rSection}{Bio}

I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher in \ac{PeRL} lab, University of Michigan. The on-going project is \ac{AUV} navigation and path planning, where my research interests are in visual Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), navigation and computer vision. During B.S. and M.S. programs from Robotics Lab in Seoul National University, I also had research experience on mobile robot motion planning and dynamics/control of parallel manipulator.
